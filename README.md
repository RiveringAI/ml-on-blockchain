# ml-on-blockchain (mlob)

Machine Learning on Blockchain (mlob) shares open datasets on blockchain (FileCoin) as storage network, and provides open algorithms to community to run rapid machine learning development. 

## Open DataSets
- **Create** - create a new dataset with descriptions, references of its original sources, licenses
- **Upload** - upload large open datasets to mlob to share with the community. These datasets are phyiscally stored in at least 5 geo-replicated locations in FileCoin network. 
- **Search** - search existing open datasets available at mlob.
- **Download** - download (retrieve) the open datasets from FileCoin storage network

## Open Algorithms
- **Upload** - upload an open machine learning algorithms and data models (if any) that will use the related open datasets.
- **Search** - search existing open algorithms available at mlob.
- **Download** - download (retrieve) the open algorithms and data models (if any) from FileCoin storage network
- **Review** - provide a review rating of the open algorithms
